# SORL: Self-Optimizing Reinforcement Learning 🤖

Dive deep into reinforcement learning with a twist. SORL aims to not only maximize rewards but also to learn with minimal computational effort, ensuring efficient and effective agent behaviors.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Dual Objectives**: Balance reward maximization and computational efficiency.
- **Grid World Example**: A simple, understandable RL environment to showcase SORL.
- **Dynamic Learning**: Witness the agent learning to be resource-conscious.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluate the performance difference between traditional and SORL agents.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download and Navigate**:
   ```bash
   # Download the provided SORL implementation
   cd path-to-downloaded-files
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
3. **Run the SORL Example**:
   ```bash
   python sorl_gridworld_example.py
4. **Analyze and Compare**: Dive into the results to see the efficiency of the SORL agent.
